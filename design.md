Design Style Name: "Graphic Realism" / "Sci-Fi Brutalism"
Use the following sections to instruct the AI on exactly what you want.

1. Core Concept: Graphic Realism
Definition: A synthesis of simplified, impactful graphic design with the fidelity of the real world.

Prompt Keyword: Graphic Realism

Instruction to AI: "Create a design that feels grounded in reality but is heavily stylized. Objects and UI elements should look like functional, tangible items (high fidelity) but with unnecessary noise removed. Focus on clean shapes and clear forms that convey function."

2. Color Palette
Primary Backgrounds: Dark, metallic, or neutral tones (slate grey, deep black, raw concrete).

Accent Colors: High-saturation, "acidic" or neon colors used for visibility and impact.

Specifics: Bright "slime" green, alert red, electric blue, and vibrant orange.

Usage: Use these bright colors for buttons, highlights, and critical information against the dark, moody background.

Instruction to AI: "Use a high-contrast color palette. The background should be dark, industrial, or metallic. Use vivid, neon highlights (acid green, bright red) for accents, similar to Formula 1 liveries or safety warnings."

3. Typography (Text Styles)
Font Style: Monospaced (code-like), Sans-Serif, Geometric.

Case: Predominantly lowercase for headers and titles (evoking a sense of understated confidence).

Vibe: Technical, medical, bureaucratic, and "brutalist."

Instruction to AI: "Use a monospaced font family (like Roboto Mono or Courier). Keep headings in lowercase. The typography should look like data readouts or technical manuals. Use large, bold text for key statements, similar to Swiss graphic design or warning labels."

4. Layout & Composition (UI/UX)
Style: Brutalist & Deconstructed.

Grid: Ignore traditional clean grids; embrace "collage-like," fragmented, or disjointed layouts (inspired by the design studio Metahaven).

Spacing: Use vast negative space (empty areas) contrasted with dense clusters of information.

Instruction to AI: "Adopt a brutalist web design approach. Use raw, unpolished layouts. Allow elements to overlap or be spaced unevenly. Combine stark, empty spaces with dense, technical information blocks. Avoid making it look too 'corporate' or 'friendly'."

5. Graphic Elements & Iconography
Shapes: Sharp, angular, geometric.

Icons: Glyphs, obscure symbols, warning signs, and abstract shapes (circles, triangles, crosses).

Inspirations: Sony PS2 styling, Ghost in the Shell interfaces, Nike technical wear.

Texture: Striped patterns (caution tape style), noise/grain, digital glitches.

Instruction to AI: "Incorporate technical glyphs and geometric symbols (triangles, crosses) as decorative elements. Use striped patterns and 'hazard' aesthetics. The UI should feel like a futuristic operating system or a medical interface."

6. Imagery & Materials
Materials: Synthetic fabrics, matte plastic, brushed metal, glass.

Vibe: "Tactile minimalism." It should look like you can touch it.

Instruction to AI: "Images should feature objects that look engineered and functional. Use textures that resemble synthetic materials, frosted glass, and matte metal. Lighting should be dramatic with heavy shadows."

Summary Prompt for AI Generation
If you need a single paragraph to give to an AI, use this:

"Design a website interface in the style of 'Graphic Realism' and 'Sci-Fi Brutalism.' The aesthetic should combine the high-performance look of Formula 1 racing with the dystopian vibe of Ghost in the Shell. Use a dark, monochromatic background (slate grey/black) with high-contrast, neon accent colors (acid green, bright red). The typography should be exclusively monospaced and largely lowercase, resembling technical data or code. The layout should be experimental and brutalist, using fragmented grids, vast negative space, and overlapping elements. Include graphic elements like technical glyphs, striped hazard patterns, and geometric shapes. The overall feel should be mysterious, clinical, and highly functional."
